# NEXUS-2020
This is the code used by our team in the Nexus event organised by Kshitij in 2020 in which we were placed first. The event consisted of 2 rounds, which had to do something with computer vision. First round consisted of green circles and non green trinagles and rectangles as obstecles and the bot had to decide the path based on the shape after blinking LED on board a number of times depending on the instruction given during the teams turn. The second round consisted of 3 different coloured circles and at the junction there is a barcode placed representing a 4 bit number. The objective was to read it and follow a particular circular path until the end. At the end of the couse a black rectangle was placed and the bot had to turn according to the average values of the barcodes.

## Team
The team consisted of four members:
1) Agni Keyoor Purani
2) Vinit Raj
3) Aditya Agarwaal
4) Anubhav Prasad

## About the files
Though the files are a bit messy and hard to understand they worked really good and got the team the first place in the event. The Task1.cpp corresponds to the round 1 of this event and the Task2.cpp corresponds to the round 2 of the event. 
The .ino files are arduino files that can be opened in Arduino IDE. An pop-up might show up that this file is not within its project directory or so and would ask you if it is ok to create one. You can click OK or Yes. This program was written for Arduino UNO.
